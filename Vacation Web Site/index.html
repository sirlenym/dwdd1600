        <h2>Our History</h2>

        <p>Above is our team from 2018.

            The year was 1999. Ricky Martin’s “Livin’ La Vida Loca” ruled the airwaves. That’s when two young gringos,
            via a fateful “roommate wanted” ad, met in Costa Rica. From our tiny apartment with dial-up internet, we
            began planning trips to Costa Rica for visiting family and friends. Soon after, we got the idea to start a
            business. With little experience and less money, we launched what would become one of Costa Rica’s first
            online travel agencies.

            After 20+ years and over 65,000 vacations planned, we’re still finding ways to improve, always listening to
            client feedback. Travel is a constantly evolving ecosystem, so we adapt our process and product offering
            accordingly. Two decades later, one thing remains unchanged: our passion for creating lifelong memories
            through the joy of travel.</p>
