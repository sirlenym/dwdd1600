        <h2>Pre-Columbian Era</h2>
        <p>The pre-Columbian civilizations were extraordinary developments in human society and culture, ranking with
            the early civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China. Like the ancient urban societies of the Old World,
            those in the New World were characterized by kingdoms and empires, great monuments and cities, and
            refinements in the arts, metallurgy, and writing; the ancient civilizations of the Americas also display in
            their histories similar cyclical ...(100 of 53028 words). Before the arrival of Europeans, Honduras was
            inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the Maya, Lenca, and Pech. The Maya civilization, in
            particular, left a significant mark on the region with their impressive cities and advanced knowledge of
            astronomy and mathematics.</p>

        <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>
        <p>In 1502, <em>Christopher Columbus</em> arrived in Honduras during his fourth voyage to the Americas. The
            Spanish
            quickly established control over the region, leading to the exploitation of indigenous peoples and
            resources.
            Honduras became part of the Spanish Empire and was governed as a province of the Captaincy General of
            Guatemala. When the Spanish arrived to colonize Honduras, the land was occupied by a variety of indigenous
            peoples, the most advanced of whom were the Maya. Gold stimulated Spanish conquest of the area early in the
            16th century, and the Honduran gold-mining town of Gracias became the capital of Spanish Central America
            (the Audiencia de los Confines) in 1544. By 1548, however, the Spaniards had exhausted the gold, and
            Santiago (Antigua Guatemala) became the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. Honduras, with its capital
            at Comayagua and agriculture the base of its economy, was a province of that kingdom (audiencia) within the
            Viceroyalty of New Spain.</p>

        <h2>Independence and Modern History</h2>
        <p>Independence from Spain came in 1821 and from Mexico in 1823, when Honduras joined in the formation of the
            United Provinces of Central America. Friction between Liberal and Conservative factions soon undermined the
            federation, however. In general, the Liberals favoured republicanism, freer trade, less government
            regulation, removal of the Catholic clergy’s political and economic powers, and imitation of foreign models
            of development. Conservatives defended the clergy, leaned toward monarchism, mistrusted foreign models, and
            were generally more traditional and pro-Spanish in their outlook. In 1830 a Honduran Liberal, Francisco
            Morazán, became president of this federation, and for a decade he promoted Liberal policies that curtailed
            the traditional power and privileges of the clergy and increased agricultural exports. Conservative and
            popular opposition to Liberal policies led to the collapse of the federation, and Honduras declared its
            absolute independence on November 5, 1838.</p>
